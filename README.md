This application is used for learning how to use java script in a real world example.

Functionality includes; disabling buttons so they may only be clicked once, hiding empty rows
unless a button is specifically clicked on, using hidden checkboxes for deletions, and smooth scrolling
rather than a "jumpy/snappy" action caused by page navigation.
